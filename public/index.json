Different surgical approaches were categorized taking into consideration two variables a) hard tissue management (defined as debridement, saucerization or marginal resective surgery of maxillary necrotic bone) and b) soft tissue management (defined as type of flap design and related modality of wound-healing). For the retrospective cohort study, 103 MRONJ patients were enrolled and a total of 128 surgical procedures were performed. The role of radical-intended surgery using local flaps in MRONJ treatment was investigated, as well as palliative treatments. All stage I-II patients completely healed when a combination of radical necrotic bone surgery associated with a first intention healing of soft tissues was obtained. In stage III, when a patient was not eligible for maxillo-facial surgery, the use of palliative surgical strategies was effective in symptom relief in order to maintain a better quality of life for the duration of the patient's life. Oral surgery with radical intent associated with a flap design able to ensure first intention healing might represent a valid option for the majority of MRONJ patients. The designed decision tree allows clinicians to assess individual surgical approaches for MRONJ treatment in accordance with patient-centered outcomes and surgical skills.","tags":["paper"],"title":"Oral Surgical Management of Bone and Soft Tissues in MRONJ Treatment A Decisional Tree","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alessandro Albano","Mariangela Sciandra","Antonella Plaia"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1653609600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1653609600,"objectID":"85bdd87701ab0b9dbc75a1d428d5a37c","permalink":"http://localhost:4321/publication/journal-article/02/","publishdate":"2022-05-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article/02/","section":"publication","summary":"Label Ranking (LR) is an emerging non-standard supervised classification problem with practical applications in different research fields. The Label Ranking task aims at building preference models that learn to order a finite set of labels based on a set of predictor features. One of the most successful approaches to tackling the LR problem consists of using decision tree ensemble models, such as bagging, random forest, and boosting. However, these approaches, coming from the classical unweighted rank correlation measures, are not sensitive to label importance. Nevertheless, in many settings, failing to predict the ranking position of a highly relevant label should be considered more serious than failing to predict a negligible one. Moreover, an efficient classifier should be able to take into account the similarity between the elements to be ranked. The main contribution of this paper is to formulate, for the first time, a more flexible label ranking ensemble model which encodes the similarity structure and a measure of the individual label importance. Precisely, the proposed method consists of three item-weighted versions of the AdaBoost boosting algorithm for label ranking. The predictive performance of our proposal is investigated both through simulations and applications to three real datasets.","tags":["paper"],"title":"A weighted distance-based approach with boosted decision trees for label ranking","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Vera Panzarella","Mauceri","Baschi","Maniscalco","Campisi","Monastero"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1653609600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1653609600,"objectID":"44ceb7a21cd5e516ad98786f42a3a0ae","permalink":"http://localhost:4321/publication/journal-article/05/","publishdate":"2022-05-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article/05/","section":"publication","summary":"The relationship between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and periodontitis has been recently investigated with heterogenous results.This study aims to evaluate the oral health status and its relationship with cognitive impairment of participants, enrolled in the Zabút Aging Project, a community-based cohort study performed in a rural community in Sicily, Italy. A case-control study (20 subjects with AD, 20 with amnestic mild cognitive impairment [aMCI], and 20 controls) was conducted. The protocol included a comprehensive medical and cognitive-behavioral examination. Full-mouth evaluation, microbial analysis of subgingival plaque samples (by RT-PCR analysis), and oral health-related quality of life (OHR-QoL) were evaluated.The decayed, missing, and filled teeth (DMFT) total score of AD subjects was significantly higher than aMCI (p = 0.009) and controls (p = 0.001). Furthermore, the \"M\" component of DMFT (i.e., the number of missing teeth) was significantly higher in AD than in aMCI (p \u003c 0.001) and controls (p \u003c 0.001). A Poisson regression model revealed that age (p \u003c 0.001), male gender (p = 0.001), and AD (p = 0.001) were positively correlated with DMFT. Concerning oral microbial load, the presence of Fusobacterium nucleatum was significantly higher in AD than in controls (p = 0.02), and a higher load of Treponema denticola was found in aMCI than with AD (p = 0.004). OHR-QoL scores did not differ among the groups.The current research suggests that AD is associated with chronic periodontitis, which is capable of determining tooth loss due to the pathogenicity of Fusobacterium nucleatum. These data remain to be confirmed in larger population-based cohorts.","tags":["paper"],"title":"Oral Health Status in Subjects with Amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer's Disease: Data from the Zabút Aging Project","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Giacomo Oteri","De Ponte","Runci","Peditto","Marcianò","Cicciù"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1653609600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1653609600,"objectID":"aa90886577a52541aa1c183e21c14c1d","permalink":"http://localhost:4321/publication/journal-article/04/","publishdate":"2022-05-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article/04/","section":"publication","summary":"The aim of this study is to analyze the clinical outcome and the change in oral-health-related quality of life (QoL) of osteoporotic patients affected by medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaws (MRONJ).

A clinical 12 months postoperative evaluation has been performed and the complete mucosal healing, the absence of swelling and suppuration, and no signs of disease recurrence were defined like success parameters. Quality-of-life surveys tests like EORTC QQ-C30 and QLQ-HN35 appendices in conjunction with a perceived oral health visual analog scale (VAS) were administered before (time of diagnosis of MRONJ) and after surgery (at least 6 months) in order to record the different oral health status of the treated patients. The majority of MRONJ-diagnosed patients complained symptoms like pain, eating discomfort, and sense problems, with occasional involvement of the social dimension. There was a prevalence of troubles with social eating and social contact.The complete mucosal healing was achieved in 100% of the patients and the administered survey tests reported a significant improvement in all the investigated spheres. Similarly, an increased mean score of perceived oral health VAS was reported.Marginal-resective surgery of the necrotic jaw bone can be an effective treatment of osteoporotic patients affected by localized MRONJ.

Topic discovering is an unsupervised process that does not guarantee the interpretability of its output. Hence, the automatic evaluation of topic coherence has attracted the interest of many researchers over the last decade, and it is an open research area. The present article offers a new quality evaluation method based on Statistically Validated Networks (SVNs). The proposed probabilistic approach consists of representing each topic as a weighted network of its most probable words. The presence of a link between each pair of words is assessed by statistically validating their co-occurrence in sentences against the null hypothesis of random co-occurrence. The proposed method allows one to distinguish between high-quality and low-quality topics, by making use of a battery of statistical tests. The statistically significant pairwise associations of words represented by the links in the SVN might reasonably be expected to be strictly related to the semantic coherence and interpretability of a topic. Therefore, the more connected the network, the more coherent the topic in question. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method through an analysis of a real text corpus, which shows that the proposed measure is more correlated with human judgement than the state-of-the-art coherence measures.","tags":["paper"],"title":"Ranking coherence in Topic Models using Statistically Validated Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alfano","Biagio Lenzitti","Lo Bosco","Muriana","Piazza","Vizzini"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1580083200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1580083200,"objectID":"56f2006544f1f4ec670819586d78756f","permalink":"http://localhost:4321/publication/journal-article/06/","publishdate":"2020-01-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article/06/","section":"publication","summary":"The paper presents a web-based application, SIMPLE, that facilitates medical text comprehension by identifying the health-related terms of a medical text and providing the corresponding consumer terms and explanations. The comprehension of a medical text is often a difficult task for laypeople because it requires semantic abilities that can differ from a person to another, depending on his or her health-literacy level. Some systems have been developed for facilitating the comprehension of medical texts through text simplification, either syntactical or lexical. The ones dealing with lexical simplification usually replace the original text and do not provide additional information.  We have developed the SIMPLE application that is able to automatically 1) identify medical terms in a medical text by using medical vocabularies 2) translate the medical terms into consumer terms through medical-consumer thesauri 3) provide term explanations by using health-consumer dictionaries. SIMPLE can be used as a standalone web application or can it be embedded into common health platforms for real time identification and explanation of medical terms. At present, it works with English and Italian texts but it can be easily extended to other languages. We have run subjective tests with both medical experts and non-experts as well as objective tests to verify the effectiveness of SIMPLE and its simplicity of use. Non-experts found SIMPLE easy to use and responsive. The big majority of respondents confirmed they were helped by SIMPLE in understanding medical texts and declared their willingness to continue using SIMPLE and to recommend it to other people. The subjective tests, conducted with medical experts on a set of Italian radiology reports, showed an agreement between SIMPLE and the experts, on the highlighted medical terms, that ranges between 74.05 % and 81.16 % as well as an agreement of around 60 % on the consumer term translation. The objective tests showed that the consumer terms, provided by SIMPLE, are, on average, eighteen times more familiar than the relative medical terms so proving, once more, the effectiveness of SIMPLE in simplifying the medical terms. The performed tests demonstrate the effectiveness of SIMPLE, its simplicity of use and the willingness of people in continuing with its use. SIMPLE provides, with a good agreement level, the same information that medical experts would provide. Finally, the consumer terms are 'objectively' more familiar than the related technical terms and as a consequence, much easier to understand.","tags":["paper"],"title":" Design, development and validation of a system for automatic help to medical text understanding","type":"publication"}]
