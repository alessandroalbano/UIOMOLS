Mariangela Sciandra is an Associate Professor of Statistics at the Department of Economics, Business, and Statistics at the University of Palermo. Her main research areas include Generalized Linear Mixed Effects Models, with a focus on inferential and diagnostic tools. She has contributed to defining R2 measures for GLMM and exploring flexible modeling of autocorrelation structures for clustered data. She is also involved in applying statistical methods to complex ecological systems, such as monitoring the health status of the seagrass Posidonia oceanica. Her research extends to Classification Trees for ordinal responses, investigating methods based on the most appropriate distance for multivariate ordinal response data. Currently, she is actively engaged in Textual Data Analysis and Preference data. Additionally, she has supervised doctoral theses at the Doctorate in Economics and Statistics.
