Bio:
Giacomo Oteri (Messina RU) is responsible for the UNIME Research Unit. He is a Full Professor of Dental Diseases, Head of the Postgraduate Program of Oral Surgery at the Department of Biomedical and Dental Sciences and Morpho functional Imaging, at the University of Messina and Head of the Clinic of Dentistry University Hospital "Policlinico Gaetano Martino" Messina.
As a referent for the Center for the prevention and treatment of Medication-related Osteonecrosis of the Jaw (MRONJ) designated by the Italian Society of Oral Pathology and Oral Medicine, Giacomo Oteri has 15 years of experience in the diagnosis, management and treatment of MRONJ, validated by a proven track record reporting 123 MRONJ surgeries and many cohort studies published in the literature on the subject.
Giacomo Oteri's surgical activity represents a considerable amount of the revenue of the Clinic of Dentistry. The scientific production of Professor Oteri is strongly focused on MRONJ surgical treatment and quality of life. The research group of Professor Oteri developed a combined paradigm to support clinical decision-making which allows tailoring of prevention and treatment strategies based on patient's needs and quality of life preservation and emphasizes the role of soft tissue management for achieving stable and prolonged healing. The latest publications focused on the pathophysiology of MRONJ using epidemiological data as early predictors of disease outcome promoting multidisciplinary care and exploring MRONJ prognosis in correlation with the clinic-pathological features with innovative applications of immune-histochemistry. UNIME research unit could provide easy population sampling for the investigation and serve the project with infrastructure and technology. Professor Giacomo Oteri participated in the Italian Consensus Update 2020 on MRONJ, and his consolidated collaboration with the U.O. of Oral Medicine of the AOUP "Policlinico P. Giaccone" of Palermo ensures the expertise
in optimising patient care for MRONJ patients and research pathways developing a functioning scientific unit.
