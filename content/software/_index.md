## UIOMOLS  
### A Unified Italian Oral Medicine and Orthodontic Language System  
*A prototype Natural Language Processing application in healthcare*

The platform was developed within the project **“A Unified Italian Oral Medicine and Orthodontic Language System (UIOMOLS)”**, funded by the Italian **PNRR** program and carried out through the collaboration of three research units from:

- University of Palermo (UNIPA)  
- University of Messina (UNIME)  
- University of Catania (UNICT)  

The main objective of the project is the enhancement and harmonization of clinical and textual data contained in Electronic Health Records (EHRs), which are available in heterogeneous formats. These data are transformed into structured knowledge to support **diagnosis, research, and education** in the fields of oral medicine and orthodontics.

By integrating **statistical analysis methods** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques**, the platform enables the extraction, organization, and interpretation of heterogeneous clinical data. This approach supports a deeper understanding of care pathways and contributes to improving the overall quality of healthcare delivery.
