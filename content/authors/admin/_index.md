The Electronic Health Record (EHR) stores patient health data digitally, vital for healthcare advancement recognized by PNRR. Italian Guidelines (GL) aim to create an ecosystem of data-driven services for diagnosis, treatment, and personalized care.

GL advocate for SNOMED-CT adoption for coding systems. This project applies NLP to free-text clinical records in Oral Medicine and Orthodontics, aiding diagnosis and treatment customization, potentially transforming medical education. Advanced analytics (AI and ML) services will make it possible to exploit the enormous potential of health data to support research in the medical field, thus improving prevention, diagnosis, therapies, health monitoring and management. The expected outcome is a user-friendly digital platform facilitating seamless data exchange and enhancing patient care.

This projects is developed by the collaborative efforts of three research units based at the University of Palermo([UNIPA](https://www.unipa.it)), University of Messina ([UNIME](https://www.unime.it/)), and University of Catania ([UNICT](https://www.unict.it/)).
