  abstract     = {The aim of this study is to analyze the clinical outcome and the change in oral-health-related quality of life (QoL) of osteoporotic patients affected by medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaws (MRONJ). Forty-one patients, consecutively treated for a 10-year period, were retrospectively analyzed. All the patients underwent a marginal osseous resective jaw surgery. A clinical 12 months postoperative evaluation has been performed and the complete mucosal healing, the absence of swelling and suppuration, and no signs of disease recurrence were defined like success parameters. Quality-of-life surveys tests like EORTC QQ-C30 and QLQ-HN35 appendices in conjunction with a perceived oral health visual analog scale (VAS) were administered before (time of diagnosis of MRONJ) and after surgery (at least 6 months) in order to record the different oral health status of the treated patients. The majority of MRONJ-diagnosed patients complained symptoms like pain, eating discomfort, and sense problems, with occasional involvement of the social dimension. There was a prevalence of troubles with social eating and social contact.The complete mucosal healing was achieved in 100\% of the patients and the administered survey tests reported a significant improvement in all the investigated spheres. Similarly, an increased mean score of perceived oral health VAS was reported.Marginal-resective surgery of the necrotic jaw bone can be an effective treatment of osteoporotic patients affected by localized MRONJ. Quality-of-life parameters are demonstrated to be useful for recording the patient-centered outcome of MRONJ treatment.},
